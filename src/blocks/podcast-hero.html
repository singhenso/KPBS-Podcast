            Bay Curious is a show about your questions – and the adventures you
            find when you go looking for the answers. Join host Olivia
            Allen-Price to explore all aspects of the Bay Area – from the debate
            over "Frisco", to the dinosaurs that once roamed California, to the
            causes of homelessness. Whether you lived here your whole life, or
            just arrived, Bay Curious will deepen your understanding of this
            place you call home.
